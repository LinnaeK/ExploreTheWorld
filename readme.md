Select your region of choice and face animals like you have never seen before. You will be provided with the letters for each animal, but they will be all scrambled up. It will be your job to figure out the correct order of the letters. Once the letters are ordered you will be provided with a picture of the animal along with an interesting fact regarding them. But hurry, you have to solve each of the eight animals in a region before the timer runs out or else you will have to start all over again!
